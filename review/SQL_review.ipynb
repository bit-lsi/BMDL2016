    "# SQL Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "* SQL is an ANSI (American National Standards Institute) standard, but there are many different versions of the\n",
    "  SQL language.\n",
    "* SQL is the standard language for Relation Database System .Different dialects used for different databases like MYsql,Oracle     and so  on\n",
    "\n",
    "# SQL Commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard SQL commands to interact with relational databases are CREATE, SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE,DELETE and DROP. These commands can be classified into groups based on their nature:\n",
    "\n",
    "### DDL - Data Definition Language:\n",
    "\n",
    "* CREATE -Creates a new table, a view of a table, or other object in database\n",
    "* ALTER -Modifies an existing database object, such as a table.\n",
    "* DROP -Deletes an entire table, a view of a table or other object in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Note : DDL commands include an implicit commit\n",
    "\n",
    "### DML - Data Manipulation Language:\n",
    "\n",
    "* INSERT-Creates a record\n",
    "* UPDATE-Modifies records\n",
    "* DELETE-Deletes records\n",
    "\n",
    "* Note : No implicit commit, use commit after insertion/deletion accordingly\n",
    "\n",
    "### DCL - Data Control Language:\n",
    "\n",
    "* GRANT-Gives a privilege to user\n",
    "* REVOKE-Takes back privileges granted from user\n",
    "\n",
    "### DQL - Data Query Language:\n",
    "\n",
    "* SELECT-Retrieves certain records from one or more tables\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is NULL value in SQL?\n",
    "\n",
    "* A NULL value in a table is a value in a field that appears to be blank, which means a field with a NULL value is a\n",
    "  field with no value.\n",
    "\n",
    "* It is very important to understand that a NULL value is different than a zero value or a field that contains spaces. A\n",
    "  field with a NULL value is one that has been left blank during record creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Commonly used SQL Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "Constraints are the rules enforced on data columns on table\n",
    "\n",
    "* NOT NULL Constraint: Ensures that a column cannot have NULL value.\n",
    "* DEFAULT Constraint: Provides a default value for a column when none is specified.\n",
    "* UNIQUE Constraint: Ensures that all values in a column are different.\n",
    "* PRIMARY Key: Uniquely identified each rows/records in a database table.\n",
    "* FOREIGN Key: Uniquely identified a rows/records in any another database table.\n",
    "* CHECK Constraint: The CHECK constraint ensures that all values in a column satisfy certain conditions.\n",
    "* INDEX: Use to create and retrieve data from the database very quickly"
