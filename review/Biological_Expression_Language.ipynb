    "`BEL` is a `domain specific language (DSL)` for biological context. It can be used by domain specialists to design informations in a way that is readable by humans and by machines. `DSL`'s can be used to digitalize data and run automated analyses against it. In conclusion: `BEL` is a language that follows specific rules (Syntax) to describe biological interactions in a computable way."
