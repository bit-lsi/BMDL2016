    "An individual object of a certain class. An object obj that belongs to a class Circle, for example, is an instance of the class Circle.\n",

    "A variable that is defined inside a method and belongs only to the current instance of a class.\n",

    "The assignment of more than one behavior to a particular function. The operation performed varies by the types of objects or arguments involved.\n",
